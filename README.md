**Project Title:** See Any GP

**Description:**

You are a patient trying to book an appointment with your GP (general practitioner - also family doctor) but you keep getting disappointed after queuing for ages on the surgery appointments line as all appointments have been booked. You think - what if I could get an appointment with any GP without having to join the queue on the phone? This is where SeeAnyGP comes in: a service where you can see/access available GPs in your location and book appointments to fit your schedule.
